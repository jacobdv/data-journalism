# Data Journalism
This project provides an interactive scatterplot exploring the relationship between age and income in the United States at the state level. Primarily based in Javascript's D3 library, the app.js file appends an SVG element into the index.html and builds a chart within it. The chart includes axes and datapoints which update if the user selects a different variable for either the x or y axis. Code commenting should explain each of the functions purpose in more detail but as an overview, the top section of the code simply sets initial parameters for the plot such as height, width, and starting x and y variables. The middle section includes all the functions that are needed in any re-drawing of the scatterplot. These include functions for the x and y axes, the circles themseleves, labels on the circles, and the labels for the axes. Finally, the bottom portion of the code interacts with the data.csv and listens for user interaction. This is where the data is imported and where the plot is initially rendered. Additionally, event listeners on both the x and y label groups update the x and y variables and call the functions to update the scatterplot when necessary.
